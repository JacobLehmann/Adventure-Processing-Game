Assignment FINAL Description

THIS ASSIGNMENT IS A MORE THOUGHT AND FULLY REALIZED VERSION OF OUR PREVIOUS GAME ASSIGNMENT. IT NOW CONTAINS MORE OBSTACLES, TRAPS, BUTTON, INVISIBLE WALLS, AND SEVERAL OTHER LEVELS.
EACH LEVEL WAS DESIGNED USING STENCYL FOR THE TEXTILES TO MAKE THE BASE OF OUR LEVEL. FROM THERE STENCYL HELPED US CREATE THE OBSTACLES WITHIN THE GAME. THIS GAME IS A SEMI PUZZLE GAME
ONE WHERE YOU MUST DEAL WITH THE PUZZLE SET FORTH TO YOU THE PLAYER BY LOKI! 


JACOB COMING FROM ANOTHER GROUP HAD QUITE A BIT OF CODE AND WORKED ON THE LEVEL. HE DID MOST OF THE PROGRAMMING FROM THE INVISIBLE WALLS TO THE OBSTALCES WITHIN THE GAME.

ARMANDO CREATED THE README AND DESCRIPTION FILES. ADDED SOUND TO THE GAME AND CHANGED A BIT OF CODE. The button function as well as the level design were done by the both of us.

CHALLENGING PART WAS WORKING TOGETHER. WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER BUT SOMETIMES IT WAS A BIT DIFFICULTY TO GET WORK DONE WITH OUR DIFFERENT SCHEDULES. THE MUTE BUTTON AND SOUNDS
BECAME A PROBLEM WITH COMPILING AND IT MADE IT REALLY HARD ONCE TIME WAS NEAR THE END.
